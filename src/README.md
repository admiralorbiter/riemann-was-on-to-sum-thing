Generate solids based on functions in order to estimate the volume and 3d print solids.

Goal of the project is to easily generate code that will be used for a 3d printer to print the solids for a Calc class.
Designed so a math teacher with no programming background will be able to use.

Currently program is split into three different programs. First, areaUnderFunction, calculates and shows the area under a curve.
The second, VolumeSolidofRevolution, calculates and displays the solid of a revolution.
The application, Reimann, will be the final application where it takes in input, calculates and displays the solid, then generates the 
code for the 3d printer.
