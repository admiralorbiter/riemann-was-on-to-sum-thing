The goal of the project is to easily generate code that will be used for a 3d printer to print the solids for a Calc class.
Designed so a math teacher with no programming background will be able to use.

Currently program is split into three different programs. 
First, areaUnderFunction, calculates and shows the area under a curve.
The second, VolumeSolidofRevolution, calculates and displays the solid of a revolution.
The application, Reimann, will be the final application where it takes in input, calculates and displays the solid, then generates the 
code for the 3d printer.

<p style="color:red;">The program currently has issues running. This project has been abondon due to updated workflow that allows to easily do this. In the future, this project will be
focused on calculating the area and projecting solids.</p>
